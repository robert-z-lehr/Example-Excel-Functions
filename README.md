# Crowdfunding Trends Analysis

## Purpose

## Tools:
- Excel
- Pivot Tables
- Functions

Given a [raw dataset](https://github.com/robert-z-lehr/Unveiling-Crowdfunding-Trends/raw/main/data/excel) of 1000 sample crowdfunding projects from platforms such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo, Excel tools are used to produce a [dataset](https://github.com/robert-z-lehr/Unveiling-Crowdfunding-Trends/raw/main/data/excel) which uncovers hidden trends and key market insights.

This [report](https://github.com/robert-z-lehr/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/Unveiling_Crowdfunding_Trends/results/)  addresses the following key questions:
- What are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns from this data?
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
- What are other tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?
